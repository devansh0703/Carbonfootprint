 <h1><u>Introduction To Carbon Footprint</u></h1>

	<b>It is a well known fact that excessive amounts of carbon dioxide(CO2e) cause global warming and water acidity. Both endanger marine life. And in the long run, these effects are detrimental to human life as well. The carbon footprint is the amount of greenhouse gases generated by our actions. It is measured by the number of CO2 tons emitted anually. One surefire way to do that is to monitor greenhouse gases emissions. This is where this Carbon Footprint calculator comes into use. Calculating Carbon Footprint revolves around evaluating everyday activities against the effects on the environment. For instance, if we cycled or walked to school, we have leaved a lesser carbon footprint as compared to a person who uses public transport who have leaved lesser carbon footprints in comparison of a person using private vehicle.</b>


 <h1><u>Importance of Carbon Footprint</u></h1>

	<b>The term "carbon footprint" was developed in the 1990s derived from the concept of "ecological footprint". According to Wiedmann and Minx (2008), the carbon footprint is the "Total amount of greenhouse gases emissions(GHG) caused by an organization, event or product". Carbon footprint calculation serves as an assessment tool in terms of GHG emissions and then, it serves to manage and reduce these emissions. After the calculation of carbon footprint, its detailing helps to identify weaknesses- areas of high emissions that can be eliminated or improved. Thus, lower carbon footprint is an indicator of sustainable development.</b>
